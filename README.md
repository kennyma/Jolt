# Jolt PHP Framework

Jolt is a brand new PHP5 framework. It was originally named Artisan System, but the name recently changed to Jolt. A brand new repository was started because the architecture is changing entirely.

Jolt is a fully featured MVC framework. It has influences from many different frameworks, and includes some new features itself. Building new web software in Jolt will be simple and straightforward, with an emphasis on good design, Test Driven Development, and building RESTful interfaces.
