# Welcome to Jolt
## Energize Your Application

Jolt is a new PHP5.3+ framework aimed at fast and efficient web app development. Originally named Artisan System, Jolt was renamed to be more concise and easier to speak. Many of the ideas of Artisan System will be used in Jolt, but a lot of new ideas will be implemented as well.

Jolt is hosted at [Joltcore.org](http://joltcore.org).
